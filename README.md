 Quantum-Enhanced Advection Equation Solver

Hybrid quantum-classical solver for the 1D advection equation using finite differences and VQLS.

 Problem
Solve the advection equation:
∂u/∂t + C ∂u/∂x = 0

using:
- Second-order central differences in space
- First-order implicit time discretization
- Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) for matrix inversion
